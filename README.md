## Project Description

We aim to uncover patterns and relationships that drive song popularity toÂ empower artists and producers with the knowledge to make smarter, evidence-based decisions. We will be using the Spotify dataset to analyze the features of songs and their popularity. We aim to build two models:

- Predictive Model for Song Popularity
- Causal Model for Song Duration's Effect on Popularity

## Model 1: Predictive Model for Song Popularity
